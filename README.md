## Featured Projects

- **Beacon Retail Analytics – Retail Customer Analytics & SQL Database Design (BUS211A)**
  Team project focused on addressing critical retail business problems in a competitive market. Developed Beacon Retail Analytics, a data-driven solution leveraging customer shopping behavior data to optimize customer segmentation, retention, promotional ROI, and inventory management. 
  - Cleaned and prepared a Kaggle dataset (originally 1M+ rows, 78 variables) for business analysis—reduced to 3,900 rows, 17 fields.
  - Designed and implemented a fully normalized SQL relational database (1NF, 2NF, 3NF) linking Customer, Product, Discount, Purchase, and Subscription tables.
  - Enabled advanced analysis: segmented VIPs and loyalty segments, measured discount/promotion effectiveness, and provided actionable insights for inventory optimization.
  - Demonstrated measurable improvements in retention and ROI through actionable customer intelligence.

## Research 
**A Machine Learning Approach To The Effect Of Big Data Analytics On Stock Price**  
This research investigates how big data analytics and advanced machine learning models (Random Forest, SVM, LSTM) can improve stock price prediction. By integrating historical market data, technical indicators, and sentiment analysis from social media, the study demonstrates that combining diverse datasets significantly increases forecasting accuracy for volatile markets like India’s BSE and NSE.
